# Fable/Elmish To-do app

This is a simple Fable/Elmish application modeling a basic todo app.
The repository is made for learning purposes and the generated Javascript output is not optimized.

The application is my solution for the todo exercises part of [The Elmish book](https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/) by Zaid Ajaj and is based on the prior work in the book, as well as on the Fable/Elmish template provided by the author.

The (single) application file is heavily commented as this is a learning exercise, and as a reference for future review.

## Building and running the app

First of all, start with installing the project's npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Once this is finished, you can then build and compile the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can start developing the application in watch mode using the webpack development server:

```bash
npm start
```

After the first compilation is finished, navigate to <http://localhost:8080> in your browser to see the application.

### VS Code

If you happen to use Visual Studio Code, simply hitting F5 will start the development watch mode for you and opens your default browser navigating to <http://localhost:8080.>
